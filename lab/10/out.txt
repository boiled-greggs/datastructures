Here is the tree, printed sideways.
The indentation is proportional to the depth of the node
so that the value stored at the root is the only value printed
without indentation.  Also, for each node, the right subtree
can be found above where the node is printed and indented
relative to it
        zebra
    puppy
hello
    good-bye
        friend
                daddy
            abc

After inserting stuff:
        zebra
    puppy
hello
    good-bye
        friend
                daddy
                    b
            abc
                a

After erasing stuff:
        zebra
    puppy
good-bye
    daddy
        b
