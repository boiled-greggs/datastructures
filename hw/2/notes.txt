  COMMENT CODE
  MAKE SURE ARGUMENT ERRORS ARE ALL THERE AND CORRECT


find people who scored better overall than they did in any one event

new member variable (vector of ints) to keep track of highest place in each event
may have to make new sort function to sort by event points, then set the place in the event_place vector to that index
new member variable (int overall_place) sort by points to find overall place

if overall_place > any_event_place
  write out

god willing someone will have something to write out
