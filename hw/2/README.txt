ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT: 20? 



DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
The third statistic is how many of the decathletes placed better overall
than they did in any event. It is possible in the decathlon to place higher
overall than in any event because of the cumulative point system, so it
would be interesting to see who was able to do that, and what their highest
placing event was.



RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
With the 2008 medalists, it works fine. none of the three medalists scored
higher overall than in any event, which is unsurprising.


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  

I could not get the third statistic to work with the larger data set of the
2008 olympics, nor any of the others. there is some segmentation fault happening
when sorting by the points in each event to find the placement in those events.
this is not encountered in the smaller data set. after many hours of debugging
the read_input function and trying to figure out if something was wrong with sort,
I could not find the error.

also apologies for the lack of comments in the custom involved functions i was getting frantic
