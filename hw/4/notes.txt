FUNCTIONS NEEDED:
  for accessing / modifying
    numElements
    numBins
    numElementsInBin
    getElement
    isPacked

    addElement
    removeElement
    clear

How it Works
  the jagged array is initialized with a number of bins and 0 elements.


To Do:
  [x] write pack
  [x]   need getElements etc cases for packed array
  
  [x] write unpack
  [x] write removeElement
  [x] write clear
  [x] amend print function for packed

  [ ] write errors
    [x] invalid bin numbers
    [x] modifying when packed
    [x] invalid addElement, removeElement wrt bin number
    

  [x] write assignment operator
  [x] write copy constructor

  [ ] write test cases
    [x] floats (probs modify print function)
    [x] ints
    [x] short strings
    [x] no elements
    [ ] elements in every bin
    [ ] maybe check if type element added is correct?
    [ ] copying large jagged array
    [ ] assigning large jagged array
    [ ] unpack and pack large arrays, more times.
    [x] adding element to nonexistent bin, removing
    [ ] getting nonexistant elements, numelementsinbin
    [ ] check on lms for more ideas
    [ ] some NULL stuff
  
  [ ] more tests
  [x] batch test
  
  [ ] ORDER NOTATION
