[x] have letters separated into vector

figure out what letter[i] is
  known:
    two characters in making each letter
    one is foreground, one background
    don't know which is which
  options:
    create a new letter to copy current letter
    find which two characters make up the letter
      > these can be found during original letter making
    change one character to '#' and other to '.' in letter
    check against all bitmap_letters
      if nothing returned, switch '#' and '.' and try again
    return index of bitmap_letters letter
    append char@index to string message√•k

other option:
  create string of size (output letters size) with placeholders
  iterate through bitmap_letter
    for each letter check if replacing characters 2 simple_font characters gives match
    if no match for first replacement, replace the other way
    if letter is a match to a bitmap letter, replace string character at index of output_letter to character matching with index of bitmap_letter
