What happens:
  parse_arguments()

  make vector of Image<int> objects with size of the filenames vector
    (all the images to compare)
    .Load the images

  Loop over images, compare to every other image
  for (file in filenames)
    Image<Color> out
    InitializeOutputFile(current_file, out)
    for (file in filenames)
      vector<pair<BoundingBox, BoundingBox> > regions
      if method is simple
        SimpleCompare
      if method is hashtable
        implement this
      DrawBoundingBox for every regions in regions


SimpleCompare(images[a],images[b],out,which_color,seed,percent,regions)
find a seed that matches first:
  loops over all pixels in images a and b, looking for matching areas the size of seed x seed
  if it finds a match
    HighlightSeed(out, which_color, Point(i,j), seed);
  if it didn't find a match then the function is done!
  if it did, then sets width and height to seed, then have to expand area till no more



  BoundingBox bba
  BoundingBox bbb
  add pair(bba,bbb) to regions vector
  get the percent of matching pixels
